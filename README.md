# Blockade
Python remake of [a 1976 multiplayer snake-like game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_(video_game)). Includes 4 types of AI bots:
- **Random** - randomly selects one of the possible move directions (avoids immediate death until it's inevitable).
- **Heuristic** - always chases the opponent while dodging immediate death.
- **Optimized** - the best bot achieved in an evolutionary optimization process.
- **Reinforcement learning** - bot trained from many games as a policy.
